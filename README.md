# terraform-docker-oauth2-terraform-config-generator-docker
Automates generation of a docker container to handle oauth2 forward auth via the "quay.io/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy:latest" docker image and configures traefikv2 dns settings. This will likely be moved to another forward auth container in the future but for now this solution works pretty well for its intended use-case

## NOTE: this readme is a WIP and will be updated with useful how-to information at a later time
